# Distributed Systems with Node.js: Companion Files

### THIS REPO IS STILL NEEDS MORE COMMIT, 

Hey there! Welcome to my companion files for Distributed Systems with Node.js, O'Reilly 2020. While you donâ€™t need these files to follow along with the book, Iâ€™m sharing them here to make your life easier. They can help you troubleshoot if you hit any snagsâ€”like a pesky typo or an npm package update that throws a wrench in your code.


If you can't get a program to run you may find that by looking at these files you've made a typo. Or, you may find that one day an npm package update causes an incompatibility in your program, at which point a _package-lock.json_ file in here may help you out.
