# Distributed Systems with Node.js: Companion Files

These are the companion files for Distributed Systems with Node.js, O'Reilly 2020. These files aren't required to follow along with the book; the book contains everything you need to recreate them. However, they're provided here as a convenience.

If you can't get a program to run you may find that by looking at these files you've made a typo. Or, you may find that one day an npm package update causes an incompatibility in your program, at which point a _package-lock.json_ file in here may help you out.

## Submitting Errata (or, why is the issues tab missing?)

I've disabled the "Issues" tab on this GitHub repository. Instead, if you find an issue with either the code samples or with any of the content of the book, please use this form to submit an explanation of the problem:
